# Soil Monitoring IoT System

## üìå Overview

This project demonstrates an **Arduino-based soil moisture monitoring system** integrated with a **servo motor** to automate irrigation. The system reads soil moisture levels using a sensor and activates a servo motor to simulate watering when the soil is dry. The goal is to automate irrigation, conserve water, and reduce manual labor in agriculture or home gardening.
